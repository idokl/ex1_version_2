/*
 * This Algorithm maintain graph that contains Points and edges.
 * It enables to find the shortest path between every 2 Points in the graph.
 * the BFS algorithm (=Breadth-first search) does it by building of tree that the startPoint is
 * its root and its neighbors are its sons. the BFS find all the points that the distance between
 * them to the startPoint is 1, then 2, then 3, etc.
 * When the BFS encounters the endPoint, it stop and return stack with all points in the shortest
 * path between startPoint to endPoint.
